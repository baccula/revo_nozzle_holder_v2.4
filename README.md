# Revo nozzle holder v2.4 350mm
Remix of [Andre's](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Andre/Revo_Nozzle_Skirt_Trident) skirt-mounted nozzle holder to fit Voron 2.4 350mm printers, the BOM and installation steps are the same.

This will fit up to 4 nozzles, and uses the '300mm' part from Andre's design, unmodified.
